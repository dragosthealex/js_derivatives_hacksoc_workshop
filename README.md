# JavaScript Derivatives Workshop
A little workshop organised by HackSoc Manchester covering CoffeeScript and Dart.

## Using Dart and CoffeeScript without installing

CoffeeScript: http://coffeescript.org/ (click "Try CoffeeScript")

Dart: https://dartpad.dartlang.org/

## Exercises

Try the exercises in any order, for both languages. Then try in JavaScript, and compare the differences.

All answers should be output using `alert`, `print` or `console.log`.

1. Get whether a year is a leap year.
2. Get the current date in the format "DD-MM-YYYY".
3. Reverse a number (e.g. 42 becomes 24).
4. Convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
5. Calculate the days left until Easter (27 March 2016).
6. Write a class to represent a 2D matrix of any size. The constructor should either: accept a single argument, an array of arrays (rows of columns); or accept any number of arguments (rows), each an array (columns). Each matrix should be able to multiply itself by another matrix.
